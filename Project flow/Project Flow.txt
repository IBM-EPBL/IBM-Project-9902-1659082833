Project Flow
User interacts with the UI (User Interface) to upload the image as input
The uploaded image is analyzed by the model which is integrated
Once the model analyzes the uploaded image, the prediction is showcased on the UI and OpenCV window
To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below

1.Data Collection

Collect the dataset or Create the dataset

2.Image Preprocessing.

Importing the required libraries

Loading Train data and Test data 

Quantifying images

Label Encoding

3.Model Building

Training the model

Testing the model 

4.Model Evaluation

Saving the model

5.Application Building

Create an HTML file

Build Python Code
