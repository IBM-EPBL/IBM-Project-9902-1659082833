OBJECTIVES

1.The main purpose of this project work is to find the best prediction model
 i.e. the best machine learning technique which will distinguish the Parkinson’s patient from the healthy person.
	
2.Comparing with other algorithms and building the diagnosis model with the most efficient algorithm among them.

3. To understand the problem to classify if it is a regression or a classification kind of problem.

4.To know how to pre-process the image by using different data pre-processing techniques.

5.To learn how to use OpenCV and machine learning to automatically detect Parkinson’s disease in hand-drawn images of spirals and waves.

6.To know how to find the accuracy of the model.

7.To build web applications using the Flask framework.
