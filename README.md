Detecting Parkinson’s Disease using Machine Learning
More than 10 million people are living with Parkinson’s Disease worldwide, according to the Parkinson’s Foundation.
While Parkinson’s cannot be cured, early detection along with proper medication can significantly improve symptoms and quality of life.
The researchers found that the drawing speed was slower and the pen pressure is lower among Parkinson’s patients. 
One of the indications of Parkinson’s is tremors and rigidity in the muscles, making it difficult to draw smooth spirals and waves.
It is possible to detect Parkinson’s disease using the drawings alone instead of measuring the speed and pressure of the pen on paper. 
Our goal is to quantify the visual appearance(using HOG method) of these drawings and then train a machine learning model to classify them. 
In this project, We are using, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) image descriptor along with a Random Forest classifier and Support vector Machine
to automatically detect Parkinson’s disease in hand-drawn images of spirals and waves.

Parkinson’s Disease Symptoms:The symptoms of Parkinson disease are broadly divided into two categories.
Motor symptoms
Non-motor symptoms

Motor symptoms:
This is a symptom where any voluntary action is involved. It indicates movement related disorders like tremor, rigidity,
freezing, Bradykinesia or any voluntary muscle movement.

Non-motor symptoms:
Non-motor symptoms include disorders of mood and affect with apathy, cognitive dysfunction as well as complex behavioural disorders. 
There are two other categories of PD which are divided by doctors: Primary symptom and Secondary symptom.

Primary symptoms:
It is the most important symptom. Primary symptoms are rigidity, tremor and slowness of movement.

Secondary symptoms:
It is a symptom which directly impacts the life of an individual. These can be either motor or nonmotor. 
Its effect depends on person to person. A very wide range of symptoms is associated with Parkinson’s. Besides these symptoms, 
there are some other symptoms found that lead to Parkinson’s disease. These symptoms are micrographic, decreased olfaction & postural instability,
slowing of the digestive system, constipation, fatigue, weakness and Hypotension. Speech difficulties i.e. dysphonia (impaired speech production)
and dysarthria (speech articulation difficulties) are found in patients of Parkinson’s.

Purpose:

1.The main purpose of this project work is to find the best prediction model 
i.e. the best machine learning technique which will distinguish the Parkinson’s patient from the healthy person.
2.Comparing with other algorithms and building the diagnosis model with the most efficient algorithm among them.
